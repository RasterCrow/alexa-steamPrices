# alexa-steamPrices
I developed this skill shortly after I received my Amazon Echo Dot. 
After the release of the echo devices in Italy, if you could receive a free echo dot if you developed a skill for it within the first month. 
This was the first time I developed something in node which isn't some little helpful script. 
It was also my first skill developed for Alexa.

The index.js is the main function, inside aws lambda.
Api.py is the first prototype I made for the skill in python. I later found out that you could also develop in python for alexa, but hey, I learned some js so that's nice.
