# alexa-steamPrices
I developed this skill shortly after I received my Amazon Echo Dot.  
This was the first time I developed something, which isn't some little helpful script, in node.
It was also my first skill developed for Alexa.

The index.js is the main function, inside aws lambda.
Api.py is the first prototype I made for the skill in python. I later found out that you could also develop in python for alexa, but hey, I learned some js so that's nice.
